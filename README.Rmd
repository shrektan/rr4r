# rr4r: Rust regex for R

<!-- badges: start -->
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/yutannihilation/rr4r/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yutannihilation/rr4r/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

rr4r is my practice to use Rust in an R package with the power of [extendr](https://github.com/extendr/extendr).
My current goal is to create the same interface to stringr's functions using Rust's [regex crate](https://docs.rs/regex/1.4.3/regex/).

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("yutannihilation/rr4r")
```

## Example

### `rr4r_detect()`

```{r detect}
library(rr4r)

fruit <- c("apple", "banana", "pear", "pinapple", NA)
rr4r_detect(fruit, "a")
rr4r_detect(fruit, "^a")
rr4r_detect(fruit, "a$")
rr4r_detect(fruit, "b")
rr4r_detect(fruit, "[aeiou]")
```

### `rr4r_extract()`

```{r extract}
shopping_list <- c("apples x4", "bag of flour", "bag of sugar", "milk x2")
rr4r_extract(shopping_list, "\\d")
rr4r_extract(shopping_list, "[a-z]+")
rr4r_extract(shopping_list, "[a-z]{1,4}")
rr4r_extract(shopping_list, "\\b[a-z]{1,4}\\b")
```
